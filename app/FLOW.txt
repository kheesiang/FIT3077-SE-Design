First obtain the practitioner Identifier

eg: practionerID = "http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi|850"

Use this on ENCOUNTER resource to obtain the patients of a particular practitioner: (ENCOUNTER has over 130k records)
So we have to filter it out

URL = "https://fhir.monash.edu/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/Encounter?participant.identifier=" + practionerID + "&_include=Encounter.participant.individual&_include=Encounter.patient"

The forum : https://lms.monash.edu/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1942563

It says that we can obtain the patient list, however encounter is random, to fix this we have to sort by date to be consistent and also include a count = 100 to not flood server


OTHER:
// This link will return all encounters with patient and practitioner information: LIMIT OF 50 per page, we have to use link->relation->"next" for other 50

I feel like this will allow us to store all the encounters at once, but It might waste space, and to find patients related to practitioner we have to go through all encounters which is okay

https://fhir.monash.edu/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/Encounter?_include=Encounter.participant.individual&_include=Encounter.patient

The above link was from the forum, however we can use URL to filter for each practitioner, and monitor their patients.


SO finally after obtaining the list of patients, we will then use OBSERVER to get the cholesterol values

https://fhir.monash.edu/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/Observation?_count=13&code=2093-3&patient=3689&_sort=date&_format=json

SUCH A MESS, I hope you can understand.

I HAVE CONCLUDED RESEARCH


NOTES:

If you found that there is only 1 patient assigned to a Practitioner, your application will just show that one patient info to be monitored.
EG : Practitioner/1381208
