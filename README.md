## Description
This project was done for FIT3077 Software Engineering: Architecture & Design, Sem 1, 2020. This project focuses on different design principles and patterns that should be used to create a proper system. 

This app shows helps health practitioners monitor the total cholesterol level, sytolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of their patients. The app allows the health practitioner to monitor any of these values in table form and graph form. The health practitioner will also be able to specifically select the fields or patients he/she wishes to monitor. Patients with levels above the average value will have their name highlighted in red. Furthermore, all of the values will be updated every N seconds, where N is a value set by the health practitioner. Patient data is taken from the Monash FHIR server that stores electronic medical records.
